The Fireplace Project in East Hampton, New York, is a contemporary art gallery. We are located in the former Talmage garage at 851 Springs Fireplace Road, in the Springs historic district across from the Pollock-Krasner house. 

We feature solo exhibitions, curated group exhibitions, and artistsâ€™ projects. We are a project space and therefore non-traditional in our approach. We do not represent artists, we present artists.

The Fireplace Project is directed by Edsel Williams.

We are very grateful for the continued exhibition sponsorship and support of UOVO for
this exhibition and others. UOVO is New York's #1 provider of art storage and services,
with more than 500,000 square feet of storage available across three facilities. From
climate-controlled storage and private viewing rooms, to transportation, packing, crating,
and installation services, UOVO provides an array of storage options and innovative
service and management solutions tailored to meet the specialized needs of any
collection or project. Each UOVO facility is purpose-designed and managed by a team of
industry-leading experts dedicated to ensuring that works are safeguarded with the
highest caliber of security, discretion, professionalism, and care.
